\section{September 7, 2022}

\subsection{Class Policy}

Lecturer: Professor Henry Cohn, \url{cohn@mit.edu}. Ten problem sets, six short quizzes, and two exams. Lowest two problem set scores and lowest quiz score will be dropped. Grading breakdown:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 40\% problem sets, $8$ at $5\%$ each
    \item 20\% quizzes, $5$ at $4\%$ each
    \item 40\% exams, $2$ at $20\%$ each
\end{itemize}
The textbook for this class is \textit{Algebra, 2nd Ed.} by Michael Artin. Throughout the course of the semester, we'll be covering topics in both \textbf{linear and abstract algebras}. 

\subsection{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition}
\deflabel

We'll start by introducing some notation for matrices and vectors.
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Given an $m\times n$ matrix $A$, we say that $A\in \RR^{m\times n}$, and we notate $A$ in a few different ways:
\[(A_{ij})_{1\leq i\leq n, 1\leq j\leq m}=\bordermatrix{ &&n&\cr
                &&&\cr
                m&&A_{ij}&\cr
                &&&} = 
\begin{pmatrix}A_{11}&A_{12}&\hdots & A_{1n}\\
A_{21}&A_{22}&\hdots & A_{2n}\\
\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\
A_{m1}&A_{m2}&\hdots & A_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}\]
    \item Similarly, for any $n$-dimensional vector $x$, we say that $x\in \RR^n = \RR^{n\times 1}$, and notate $x=\begin{pmatrix}x_1 & \hdots & x_n\end{pmatrix}^t$.
    \item Tensors are similar to matrices and vectors, but they're higher-dimensional equivalent. According to Prof. Cohn, they are ``wildly unclassified''. 
\end{itemize}

Here is a list of things that matrices are useful for: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear Transformations, i.e., mappings of the form $x\mapsto Ax$ over some vector space. Affine transformations are an extension of linear transformations by allowing a constant term, i.e., maps of the form $x\mapsto Ax+b$. We'll cover both in later lectures
    \item Bilinear Forms, which we'll cover in even later lectures
    \item An infinite number of other applications. We won't have time to cover everything during this semester
\end{itemize}

Per the first example, we say that matrices represent linear transformations because any $A\in \RR^{m\times n}$ defines a transformation from $\RR^n$ to $\RR^m$:

\[x = \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\ \vdots \\x_n\end{pmatrix}\in \RR^n\implies Ax = \begin{pmatrix}
A_{11}x_1 + \hdots + A_{1n}x_n \\
\vdots \\
A_{m1}x_1 + \hdots + A_{mn}x_n 
\end{pmatrix}\in \RR^{m}\]

The idea of an affine transformations is to additionally allow constant term translations after applying $A$, an idea that we'll cover in more detail later in $18.701$. 

\begin{theorem}
\proplabel

Let $A\in \RR^{m\times n}$, and $B\in \RR^{n\times p}$. Here are some key facts to remember about matrix multiplication.
\end{theorem}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $AB\in \RR^{m\times p}$
    \item $(AB)_{ik} = \sum_j A_{ij}B_{jk}$
    \item $AB$ is a composition of linear transformations. For any $x\in \RR^{p}$, $Bx\in \RR^{n}$, and $A(Bx)\in \RR^{m}$, but also $(AB)x\in \RR^m$. It can be checked that composing $A\circ B$ is the same linear transformation as $AB$. 
    \item Given another compatible matrix $C$, it is always true that $(AB)C = A(BC)$, which generalizes the idea in the last bullet point. In other words, matrix multiplication is associative. 
    \item On the other hand, it is not usually true that matrix multiplication is commutative, i.e., that $AB=BA$. 
\end{itemize}

The following is not a theorem, but is an important fact, so I'll put it in a theorem box for emphasis. 

\begin{theorem}
\thmlabel

Studying linear transformations and matrices in general should be viewed as a one-to-one relationship. In general, the intuition from one will almost always lead to intuition in the other, and studying one without the other lends itself to a poorer overall understanding of both. Linear transformations aren't the only application of matrices, but it is a very important one, and this perspective will more or less drive the way that we study matrices in this class. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Groups}

\begin{definition}
\deflabel

A \ac{group} $G$ is a set $G$ with binary operator \texttt{*} satisfying three conditions: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Associativity: $(fg)h = f(gh)$ for all $f,g,h\in G$. 
    \item Identity: $\exists I\in G$ s.t. $gI = Ig = g\quad \forall g\in G$.
    \item Inverse: $\forall g\in G$, $\exists h\in G$ s.t. $gh=hg=1$, $h=g^{-1}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The way we write the binary operator does not matter (e.g., \texttt{*}, $\cdot$, $\circ$, etc.) so long as we don't mix binary operators between different groups. 

The point of groups is that they ``act'' on stuff. More on this in later lectures. 

\begin{example}
\exlabel

Let's look at some examples and non-examples of groups.
\end{example}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(\RR, +)$ is a group. On the other hand, $(\RR, \times)$ is not a group, since $0$ has no inverse.
    \item $\GL_n(\RR) = \{A\in \RR^{n\times n}, A\text{ invertible}\}$, with the operator of normal matrix multiplication, is a group. This group of matrices is called the \ac{general linear group}. 
    \item $\SL_n(\RR) = \{A\in \RR^{n\times n}, \det A = 1\}$ is called the \ac{special linear group}. This group of matrices preserves volume and orientation (fixed determinant). 
    \item $S_n$ is the group of permutations of order $n$, with the operator of composition. This group is called the \ac{symmetric group}. For instance, an element of $S_6$ might swap $1$ and $3$, fix $4$, and cycle $2,5,6$, which we would notate $(1 3)(2 5 6)$. 
\end{itemize}
