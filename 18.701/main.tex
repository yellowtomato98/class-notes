My notes for $18.701$, ``Algebra I'', at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the Fall 2022 semester. The instructor for this course was Henry Cohn (\url{https://cohn.mit.edu/}). 

I switched to typesetting my notes about halfway through the semester, so the first half or so of this document ($\sim$ 14 lectures) was transcribed from handwritten notes many weeks after the corresponding lecture originally took place. The rest of this document was typeset in real time. All mistakes are my own.
